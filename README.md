# React Project Setup

This project provides a basic setup for creating a React application.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: recommended version : v18.12.1
- npm (Node Package Manager): recommended version : 8.19.2

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   `git clone https://github.com/nickiway/test-task-food-form.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd test-task-food-form`
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
   `npm install`
4. Start the development server:
   `npm start`
   This command will start the React development server and launch your application in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger a hot-reload, allowing you to see the updates in real-time.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your React application.
